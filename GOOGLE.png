## I. Marti-Vidal - 23 July 2021



0.- Download PolConvert from GitHub:

    git repo clone marti-vidal-i/PolConvert


1.- Install miniconda:

  1.a- Download the shell installer from
      https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers
    and follow the instructions.

  1.b- Add the conda-forge channel. Just run the command:

       conda config --add channels conda-forge


2.- Create a conda environment for polconvert:

    conda create --name PCONV python=3.9 scipy=1.6.3 numpy=1.20.2 matplotlib=3.4.1


4.- Copy the "PolConvert" directory into your favorite program path.
    E.g.:

    cp -r PolConvert $HOME/MyPrograms/.

    (let us suppose that PolConvert is stored in $HOME/MyPrograms)

5.- Add the following lines to your bash profile (or equivalent TC shell):

    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/MyPrograms
    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PYTHONPATH}/PolConvert/EU-VGOS

    (these lines should come BEFORE any other line involving PYTHONPATH
     in your ".bashrc" profile).

    Don't forget to run these bash lines before you move to next step.


2.- Install the C++ compiler and the needed packages, which are:

    - CFITSIO
    - FFTW3
    - PYTHON


7.- Compile the program:
 
   7.1- Take a look at the "setup.py" script in the PolConvert directory.
        You may need to change the "cfitsio" path defined there.

   7.2- Load the conda environment and compile:

        conda activate PCONV
        python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace


8.- Copy the "master" script located in PolConvert/EU-VGOS into the 
    directory with the data of the session to be polconverted. 
    Read the instructions in the script header and good luck.
